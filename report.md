## Application Description
For this assignment, we have built a checkout price calculator web application. This app is meant to mimic a bookstore website, similar to Indigo. As per the assignment requirements, key features of this application include adding and removing books in a checkout cart, and a checkout cart calculator. We also have a few additional features in our application including storing checkout cart info in local storage so the user can come back to it as well as a signup and login modal.

### Decision Summary

Frontend:  Vue is a relatively lightweight framework with intuitive syntax, which works well for our small application. 

Backend:  Supabase is a BaaS that allows us to have a lot of common functionality (ex. CRUD). Since our application doesn’t require a lot of custom/uncommon logic, Supabase fulfills our needs while simplifying our application infrastructure.

Database: PostgreSQL is a modern relational database and thus enforces strict model definitions and rules onto its data. 

Deployment: Netlify is PaaS that provides free cloud hosting services. With a link to a git repository, Netlify is able to set up auto deployments off of the repository's default git branch. 

### Frontend Options
#### Javascript Frameworks
The current top three frontend frameworks are [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [Angular](https://angular.io/docs). We will compare their benefits and disadvantages in order to make an informed decision on which frontend framework best fits our needs.

 1. React is the most popular framework of the three with an average of about 16,719,913 [npm downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) a week. React was released 9 years ago and has a large ecosystem of libraries and forums for us to work with. Many major websites use React as their frontend framework including Meta, Twitter, Atlassian, and Khan Academy, proving that React is a scalable and reliable framework. A basic React App can be created quite quickly in a number of ways. Two popular ways are using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Moreover, React is a lightweight framework compared to Angular, meaning it has less boilerplate code and less enforced structural requirements. Since we are looking to build a small application, it would be cumbersome to deal with a lot of boilerplate code, so this aspect of React would be ideal for us. Functional components paired with hooks have become the modern way to work with react. These concepts are less intuitive to start out with compared to lifecycle methods.

2. Vue is the newest of these three frameworks, and is not backed by a major corporation like React and Angular. Despite this, Vue is still a fairly popular framework with an average of about 3,439,590 [npm downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue) a week. Additionally, Vue has clean and verbose [documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and has its fair share of libraries to work with, though not required. Vue is also used by some large websites including GitLab, which proves its reliability and scalability. Setting up a Vue project is as simple as with React and can be done using the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html) tool or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Vue is also quite lightweight, and has a developer friendly experience. It uses Javascript variables to manage reactive state, javascript objects to manage component properties, and life cycle methods to handle different component states.

3.  Angular is the oldest of these three frameworks, and was initially released 12 years ago. The maturity of the framework is one of its key perks. As mentioned previously, Angular has a lot of boilerplate code, and has the longest learning curve. It's also an opinionated framework that isn't easily integrable with libraries outside of its ecosystem. It has a defined folder structure and file naming conventions that makes it easy to organize. By following the service and dependency injection design patterns, Angular allows for a clean separation between the UI and data layers of an application. It also uses life cycle methods to handle the different component states. For these reasons, Angular would be better suited for a large scale application where this level of organization would be favorable rather than cumbersome.

##### Why We Chose Vue
The main reasons we ended up choosing Vue was because our course project is building on top of our partners existing application which uses Vue as its frontend framework. Choosing Vue for this project gave us an opportunity to become familiar with Vue as well as its tooling and documentation. However, upon doing some research I feel as though Vue is the best choice for this project since it's a lightweight framework that’s easy to get started with, is developer friendly with an intuitive structure, and has detailed and thorough documentation. These are all ideal for creating the minimum viable product for a small checking cart calculator web application.

##### Styling
The easiest way to create consistent styling without a high fidelity Figma design (or equivalent) is to use an existing framework of styles and classes (or components). The most popular and easy to use of these frameworks is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/). We have used this in our application paired with [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) to easily create a consistent look and feel to our application that is not as generic as the default Bootstrap theme.

### Backend Options
Due to the nature of the assignment we will be comparing both backend frameworks and backend as a service (BaaS) and selecting from the option that suits us the best. The three we will be comparing are express (backend framework), firebase and supabase (BaaS). We will compare the benefits and disadvantages to make an informed decision.

1. Express (also known as Express.js) is an open-source framework built specifically for Node.js. It’s completely written in Javascript. This is a large pro because it means we would be using a unified language across both our frontend and backend. There is also extensive support and resources about how to use Express due to its popularity and increased use. A con that is preventing us from committing to using Express is that we have little experience and it usually has many issues in callbacks. To address the maturity of express, which was released in 2010, it has come to develop the ability to support thousands of concurrent actions, and has remained an open-source community.

2.  Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that builds off NoSQL databases and lets developers store and sync data between users in real time. Its core features are its REST API, the ability to send notifications, the ability to authenticate and the compilation of analytics that it provides. None of the features are particularly useful for the scale we need to build, but if we were to implement a real checkout, being able to collect analytics and easily view them would be very important. Overall, Firebase takes care of the general hassles that come associated with server-side programming with already production ready back-end storage.

3. Supabase is known as being the open-source version of Firebase alternative. However, Supabase is a relational database whereas the Firebase counterpart is NoSQL database. It has extensively developed since being founded in [2020](https://supabase.com/docs) and has authentication, auto-generated APIs, edge functions, real-time abilities and observability features all available. Since Supabase is essentially just Postgres with easier functionality, it’s compatible with Angular, React, Javascript, and Vue.

##### Why We Chose Supabase
The main reasons we ended up choosing Supabase was for multiple reasons. Supabase is compatible with Vue which is what we will be developing the frontend with. Additionally, we find relational databases give us more ease of development since it is more extensively covered in csc343. Although it was founded in 2020, being the newest framework we're considering, the ability to auto-generate APIs and its organization more easily integrating with Vue (as it was built for that in mind) appeals to us. Another criteria we considered was the fact we needed to be able to deploy our application for free, which with a weekly reminder we’ll update the deployment of our application.

### Database Options
1. MySQL is one of the most popular database sources that found its [name](https://www.mysql.com/) from the co-founders’ daughter’s name My and the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. Its architecture is based on relational algebra which limits it to single processing. Relational algebra only supports numeric, dat/time characters, spatial and some JSON types which is severely limiting for databases that might require more complicated entries. In general it’s only suitable for applications with high volumes of reads.

2. Postgresql, also known as postgres, is an open-source database management system that bases its architecture off of object relational, which allows it to multiprocess. In that sense, it allows for a lot more data types to be supported (numeric, date/time, boolean, JSON, XML, arrays etc.). In terms of its architecture the largest pro is that it’s suited for high volumes of reads and writes. It is also customizable such that many companies have unique versions of postgres and each one offers its own source of support/open-sourcing.

3. SQL Server is another relational database architecture management system that is developed by Microsoft. It can be taken with the exact same face value as MySQL with just a few differences: (1) there can be operating system compatibility issues with Mac OS and Linux since it was developed for Windows, (2) it relies mostly on .NET instead of PHP which can have simpler integration with Windows projects only and (3) requires licensing for each server.

##### Why We Chose Postgresql
In general we did not want to restrict ourselves to only high volumes of reads as users may want to save, change or share their carts. In general Postgres is the most modern option of the three with the largest community support that bases its architecture of object relational which would allow us to multiprocess. We also have ease of functionality due to databases class having more applications based on postgres than mysql.

### Deployment Options
The options we considered were Heroku, Vercel and Render. We ended up deciding on Netlify because it is specifically meant for high-performant and dynamic websites, which our check out (if developed into an e-commerce store) would fall under. There are only four pricing options but it generally allows instant rollbacks and fully deployable static assets and dynamic serverless functions, and the free tier matches our needs.
